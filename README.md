# 8 Week SQL Challenge
## About the Project
This project works through the [8 Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/), with each sub-folder containing the SQL queries for each case study.

## Development
Each case study sub-folder contains:
- Relevant database for the case study
- SQL file to create the database
- SQL file for queries on the database
- A Jupyter Notebooks file for a better user experience, which queries the database in Python (sqlite3) and shows the output of each query and the reason behind it.

## Acknowledgment
- Danny Ma's 8 Week SQL Challenge, for providing case studies to practice and showcase my SQL ability.
